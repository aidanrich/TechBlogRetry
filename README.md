# TechBlogRetry
- This is a redo on my tech-blog homework. The original repo is located here: https://github.com/aidanrich/MiniBlog
## Description
- We were tasked with creating a full stack app that would function as a tech blog.
- This blog is still in developement. Some features, like commenting on posts, deleting and updating posts are still being implemented.
- This project helped us learn about MVC, and how to make the back-end and front-end interact.
